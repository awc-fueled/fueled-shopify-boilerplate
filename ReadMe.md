##Fueled Shopify Boilerplate

Standard theme revamped from the ground up with new features and an efficient developer work flow. 

### Features Added:
   1. Basic non-intrusive geo location
   2. StoreLocation scripts
   3. Product MultiSelect variants matched with thumbnails and fexslider. 
   4. Filtering product images by variant select boxes.
   5. Google Translate Integration for international sales. 

### To Do:
   - [ ] Implement gears, a blank custom django app to increase the flexiablity of the shopify platform, ( I've already made it. )
   - [ ] Hack google translate so that we can specify the language from the Geolocation script, and dont have too see that ugly bar.
   - [X] create alt text thumbnail parser 
   - [ ] Sass up flexslider css
   - [ ] make everything responsive
   - [ ] add click anywhere exit to search bar
   - [ ] opacity change transition for search bar
   - [ ] add icons to social nav
   - [ ] article template needs to be redone, if we ever plan to use it 
   - [ ] check html for semantic improvements
